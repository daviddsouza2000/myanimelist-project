# Anime Lister Project

This is a web application I developed anonymously browse data pertaining to animated TV shows fetched from the Kitsu RESTful API.

Deployment link: https://myanimelist-project.web.app

I used [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend.

I used the [MUI library](https://mui.com/) for styled React components.

I used [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Backend as a Service (BaaS). I used the Firebase Firestore NoSQL database to store user data, Firebase Authentication to manage user accounts, and Firebase Hosting to host the web application.

I used the [Kitsu API](https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io/#) for TV show data.

A user can submit a query for a show:

![Anime Page](/pics/animepage.png)

There is a page showing detailed information about each show:

![Single Anime Page](/pics/singleanimepage.png)

A user can create an account to create a personal list of shows they can give scores for:

![Anime List](/pics/animelist.png)

Each user has a unique link to share so other users can view their list.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
